This repository  contains  most common programs in various language such as C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Go, R, etc. Of course, no one repository will serve all your projects needs. So I'll be adding more and more coding resources in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

### How this repository is helpful for you? üöó

This repository contains many programming resources and will be beneficial for anyone who is :

* new to coding
* trying to learn new coding language 
* looking for programs for quick references
* 100 days of code challanges 

I hope this reource is helpful for you in the process of building and developing a coder in yourself.


### What can you do here? üßê

* You can solve questions put up by contributors (tag moderators in comment to assign an issue to you and mention the language you will be using).
* You can put up a problem yourself.
* You can even contribute a project made by you!
